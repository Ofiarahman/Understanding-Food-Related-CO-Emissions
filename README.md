# 📊 Understanding Food-Related CO₂ Emissions (1990–2020)

This Tableau project explores **global food-related CO₂ emissions** from 1990 to 2020 using interactive data visualizations. It aims to support users—from students to researchers and policymakers—in understanding the **geographic, sectoral, and temporal patterns** of emissions related to the food system.

## 📌 Project Overview

The food system contributes substantially to global greenhouse gas emissions, yet the complexity of the data often obscures patterns and trends. This project transforms complex data into intuitive visuals that support:

- Temporal comparison of emissions (1990–2020)
- Sectoral breakdown (Agriculture, Transport, Processing, Household)
- Per capita and total national emissions
- Relationships with population and temperature
- Emissions inequality by country

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- 🌍 **Choropleth Map**: Compare CO₂ emissions per country (total and per capita)
- 📉 **Multi-line Chart**: Trend of emissions over time across selected countries
- 🧱 **Stacked Bar & Treemap**: Sectoral breakdown of emissions by year and country
- 🟢 **Bubble Plot**: Equity visualization showing emissions vs population
- ⏩ **Animated Views**: Temporal patterns revealed using Tableau’s Pages feature

## 🧪 Iterative Design Process

This dashboard was refined through a user-centered, feedback-driven process based on:
- **Munzner’s Nested Model**
- **Brehmer & Munzner’s Task Typology**
- Peer feedback and usability testing
- Layout changes from vertical to scrollable horizontal format
- Improved filters, interactivity, readability, and narrative clarity

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Simplicity and clarity often outweigh showing “everything at once”
- Visual storytelling is enhanced by layout and filter consistency
- Interactivity (hover, filters, animations) increases user engagement
- User feedback is essential to improving accessibility and usability
